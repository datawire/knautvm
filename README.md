# Kubernaut VM Images

This repository contains the tools and configuration required to create virtual machine images with Kubernetes and all of its dependencies installed and properly configured. The generated images are an omnibus that have all necessary tools and container images pre-installed to minimize initialization time at startup. 

## Prior Art

This will be the replacement for various things spread across datawire/kubernaut-vm and datawire/kubernaut-agent/packer.
